# bare-system-basics

Non-root software installer and updater for non production ready `*NIX` environments.


The `bsb.sh` setup routine brings a selection of software locally to your linux computer. Within the scope of life-science/bioinformatics, a Python3 conda environment, R and Perl libraries can be compiled as well. Optionally, find enclosed my fallback emacs configuration (see also <https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs>).

# info and trouble shooting

## how to use conda tools and non-conda libraries

- to load conda itself, execute `source <installpath>/conda/latest/bin/activate`
- to list and load a conda environment execute `conda info -e` and `conda activate [env]`
- to load non-conda installed perl packages execute `export PERL5LIB=<installpath>/perl-libs/<version>/lib/perl5`
- to load non-conda installed r packages execute `export R_LIBS=<installpath>/r-libs/<version>`
- to load non-conda installed python packages execute `export PYTHONPATH=<installpath>/python-libs/<version>`

## how to define a tool as default application
- adapt `~/.config/mimeapps.list`
- adapt `~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list`

## what to do in case of onlyoffice scaling issues
- adjust QT settings in `~/.local/share/applications/my-onlyoffice.desktop`

## how to group multiple windows in gnome application dock
- define or update StartupWMClass in `.desktop` file
